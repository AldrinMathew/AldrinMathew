I use Flutter and Dart to develop applications for Android, Windows and Linux. I am also working on a C++ project.

Current active projects are ***Storycrafter*** and ***Transliberate***, both of which are under private development. The target platforms are Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS. I am not sure about MacOS and iOS as I don't have a MacOS device to build for those platforms.

I revisited C++ and have already started a new project using that language.

Visit the [_Issues_](https://github.com/AldrinMathew/issues) respository where I post all of the issue reports and feature requests that I have made in other repositories.
