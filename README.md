I use Flutter and Dart to develop applications for Android, Windows and Linux.

Current active project is ***Storycrafter***, which is under private development. It is being developed for Windows and Linux using Dart & Flutter.

Currently, I have also started revising C++ programming, which I learnt in school from 2014 to 2016. I was one of those kids who got most programs right in computer class. But now, I don't remember much of C++. I still know the basic structure of functions, loops and everything, since Dart and C++ have some things in common. But a few things have changed for me, since the last time I wrote a program in C++, I was familiar with the C++11 Standard.
