I use Flutter and Dart to develop applications for Android, Windows and Linux.

Current active projects are ***Storycrafter*** and ***Transliberate***, both of which are under private development. The target platforms are Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS. I am not sure about MacOS and iOS as I don't have a MacOS device to build for those platforms.

Currently, I am looking into the V Programming language. I have also started revising C++ programming, which I learnt in school from 2014 to 2016. I was one of those kids who answered most questions in computer class. But now, I don't remember much of C++. I still know the basic structure of functions, loops and everything, since Dart and C++ have some things in common. But a few things have changed for me, since the last time I wrote a program in C++, I was familiar with the C++11 Standard.
